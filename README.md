# COMP551-Competition

## Getting Started

All required data is preloaded into the final submission folder, just need to run the notebooks.

### Prerequisites

Jupyter notebook with associated machine learning libraries.

## Code Structure

Project is divided into sections that parallel the sections required in the instructions of the project, namely :
* 0 Data preprocessing
* 1 Baseline Classifiers
* 2 Fully-Connected Network
* 3 Kaggle Submission (CNN)

The train_x, train_y, and test_x files are assumed to have the following paths relative to the notebooks : ./Datasets/train_x.csv.

Furthermore, we have included the saved image preprocessing results (a file generated from the 0_DataPreprocessing notebook) to ./Datasets/processed_sample_x.csv
